# Audio Buffer Fix Documentation

## Problem
The application was experiencing `input_audio_buffer_commit_empty` errors when trying to commit audio buffers to OpenAI's Realtime API. The error occurred because:

1. OpenAI's Realtime API requires at least 5 seconds (5000ms) of audio before committing
2. The original implementation was committing after only 1 second
3. The audio buffer was often empty or too small when commit was attempted

## Solution
Implemented a proper audio buffer management system:

### Key Changes:

1. **Buffer Size Tracking**: Added `audioBufferSize` and `lastAudioTime` properties to track accumulated audio data
2. **Minimum Buffer Size**: Calculate minimum required buffer size (48000 bytes = 5 seconds of PCM16 audio at 24kHz)
3. **Smart Timeout Management**: 
   - Clear existing timeout when new audio arrives
   - Wait 2 seconds after last audio chunk before attempting commit
   - Only commit if buffer has enough audio (≥5 seconds)
4. **Buffer Clearing**: Clear buffer if it's too small to avoid errors

### Audio Buffer Calculation:
```
PCM16 at 24kHz, 1 channel = 24000 samples/second × 2 bytes/sample = 48000 bytes/second
Minimum 5 seconds = 48000 × 5 = 240000 bytes
```

### Flow Diagram:
```
Audio Input → Buffer Append → Size Check → Timeout Management
                                    ↓
                            Wait 2s after last audio
                                    ↓
                          Buffer Size ≥ 5s? → YES → Commit & Create Response
                                    ↓
                                   NO → Clear Buffer
```

## Implementation Details:

1. **Buffer Tracking**: Each audio chunk size is estimated from base64 length
2. **Timeout Strategy**: Reset timeout with each new audio chunk to ensure we wait for complete speech
3. **Error Prevention**: Clear buffer when too small to prevent commit errors
4. **Resource Cleanup**: Clean up timeouts on disconnect

## Testing:
- Test with short phrases (< 5 seconds) - should clear buffer
- Test with long phrases (≥ 5 seconds) - should commit successfully
- Test with interrupted speech - should handle gracefully
