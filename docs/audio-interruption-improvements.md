# Audio Interruption Improvements

## Problem
The voice assistant was not properly stopping audio playback when interrupted by user speech. New questions would be detected while the AI was still speaking, but the previous answer would continue playing, making the conversation feel unnatural.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Incomplete Audio Stop**: The `stopCurrentAudio()` method only called `stop()` but didn't properly disconnect the audio source
2. **Audio Queue Persistence**: Queued audio chunks continued playing even after interruption
3. **Missing Server-Side Response**: The server wasn't forwarding `response.cancelled` events to the client
4. **Race Conditions**: Audio playback checks weren't comprehensive enough to prevent interrupted audio from playing

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Audio Stopping
**Before:**
```javascript
stopCurrentAudio() {
    if (this.currentAudio) {
        this.currentAudio.stop();
        this.currentAudio = null;
    }
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
stopCurrentAudio() {
    if (this.currentAudio) {
        try {
            this.currentAudio.stop();
            this.currentAudio.disconnect();  // Properly disconnect
            this.currentAudio = null;
            console.log('Audio successfully stopped and disconnected');
        } catch (error) {
            console.log('Audio was already stopped or disconnected');
            this.currentAudio = null;
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Emergency Stop Function
Added a comprehensive emergency stop function that:
- Stops current audio immediately
- Clears all queued audio
- Resets all speaking states
- Clears pending timeouts
- Updates UI to listening state

```javascript
emergencyStopAudio() {
    console.log('Emergency stop triggered - halting all audio');
    
    this.stopCurrentAudio();
    this.audioQueue = [];
    this.isSpeaking = false;
    this.isWaitingForResponse = false;
    
    if (this.interruptionTimeout) {
        clearTimeout(this.interruptionTimeout);
        this.interruptionTimeout = null;
    }
    
    this.elements.echoDevice.classList.add('idle');
    this.elements.echoDevice.classList.remove('speaking', 'listening');
    this.updateStatusText('Listening...');
}
```

### 3. Improved Audio Queue Management
**Enhanced `playNextAudio()`** to check speaking state before playing:

```javascript
async playNextAudio() {
    // Check if we're still supposed to be speaking before playing
    if (!this.isSpeaking || this.currentAudio || this.audioQueue.length === 0) {
        return;
    }
    
    // ... audio preparation ...
    
    // Final check before starting audio
    if (this.isSpeaking) {
        source.start();
    } else {
        // If interrupted while preparing, clean up
        source.disconnect();
        this.currentAudio = null;
        this.audioQueue = [];
    }
}
```

### 4. Server-Side Response Handling
Added `response.cancelled` event forwarding in server.js:

```javascript
case 'response.cancelled':
    client.isProcessingResponse = false;
    console.log(`Response cancelled for client ${clientId}`);
    client.ws.send(JSON.stringify(data));
    break;
```

### 5. Optimized Interruption Settings
Updated default values for more responsive interruption:

**Previous:**
- Interruption Threshold: 60
- Quiet Threshold: 20
- Interruption Delay: 300ms
- Min Interval: 1000ms

**New:**
- Interruption Threshold: 50 (more sensitive)
- Quiet Threshold: 15 (better noise filtering)
- Interruption Delay: 200ms (faster response)
- Min Interval: 800ms (shorter cooldown)

### 6. Comprehensive State Management
All interruption handlers now use the emergency stop function:

```javascript
case 'response.cancelled':
    console.log('Response cancelled due to interruption');
    this.emergencyStopAudio();
    break;
```

## Configuration
Added interruption settings to `.env.example`:

```env
# Interruption Detection Configuration
INTERRUPTION_THRESHOLD=50
QUIET_THRESHOLD=15
INTERRUPTION_DELAY_MS=200
MIN_INTERRUPTION_INTERVAL_MS=800
```

## Testing
To test the improvements:

1. Start a conversation with the AI
2. While the AI is speaking, speak loudly and clearly
3. The AI should stop speaking immediately
4. The system should transition to listening mode
5. Your new question should be processed without hearing the previous answer

## Benefits
- **Immediate Audio Stop**: Audio stops playing within 200ms of interruption
- **Clean State Management**: All states are properly reset
- **Natural Conversation**: Interruptions feel natural and responsive
- **Proper Resource Management**: Audio sources are properly disconnected
- **Better User Experience**: No more overlapping audio responses

## Future Improvements
- Add visual feedback during interruption (e.g., red pulse)
- Implement smart interruption based on speech content
- Add gesture-based interruption support
- Adaptive thresholds based on environment noise
